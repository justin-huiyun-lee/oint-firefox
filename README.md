# OINT (Open In New Tab)

This is a firefox extension that opens all links in a new tab-except for whitelisted websites(you can whitelist any website you want. There'll be a button in the popup for it).

The websites that don't do this are annoying, so I made this extension to fix that.

## Download

Just go to the website. When it gets approved I'll put the link here.

If you find this extension useful, consider buying me a coffee. I'd really appreciate it.
